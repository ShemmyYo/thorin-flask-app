<h2>{{ page_title }}</h2>
<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin II "Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            eventually called King under the Mountain or Mountain King[1], was the son of Thráin II, the older brother
            of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli. Thorin was best known for his
            deeds as leader of a company that infiltrated the lost Kingdom under the Mountain to take it back from Smaug
            and for leading an alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle of Five Armies.

        <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with Thorin Oakenshield's
            company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.
            Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and, apart from Balin and possibly
            Bombur, they appear more frequently as "individual" characters in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit than the rest
            of Thorin's companions, who are most often named only in group-reference.

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin,
            the father of Balin and Dwalin.

            Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's
            company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who
            bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were
            usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He
            fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II
            Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.

        <h3>Glóin</h3>
        <p>
            Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and
            younger brother of Óin.

            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the
            Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.

            In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In
            March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to
            reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them
            as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the
            nakedest dragonet new from the shell".
